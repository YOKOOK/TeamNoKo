                            <h1>Abstract</h1>
                            DNA origami is known as an innovative technology that can build various 2D and 3D
                            nanostructures
                            using DNA strands. In conventional procedure, DNA origami is folded in bulk solution such as
                            in
                            a test tube. Here, we present our project “SynthePHERE”, which aims at the folding of DNA
                            origami nanostructures in a small compartment such as in a liposome.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As a first step, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing scaffold and staple　strands
                            are
                            prepared. The DNA origami nanostructures are folded in GUVs with the temperature control of
                            the
                            solution. Since scaffold and staple strands are inside of a small reaction system of GUVs,
                            faster and efficient DNA origami folding is expected.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, introduction of staple strands into GUVs through the pores on the membrane
                            surfaces is carried out. A membrane protein streptolysin O(SLO) is used to form pores with ≈
                            27
                            nm diameter on GUV membrane surfaces. Also, SLO can get sealed when calcium ions are added.
                            By
                            closing SLO pores, scaffold and staple strands are expected to be entrapped in GUVs,
                            allowing to
                            fold DNA origami nanostructures inside GUVs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            By introducing different staple strands into a small compartment, various DNA nanostructures
                            can
                            be folded as a response. This input-output system would be applied to liposome-type
                            molecular
                            robots that can respond to outer environments, which could be used as drug delivery system.

                            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                            Modern robots receive a large amount of data from the external environment (via sensors) and
                            operate based on the feedback.
                            In order for robots to be multifunctional and high-performance, the ability of high-speed
                            mass
                            data processing is required.
                            However, molecular robots today are not advanced enough to handle large amounts of data, nor
                            do
                            they have the way to accelerate the process without external influence.
                            In our project, we used liposomes as containers that separate the inner solution from the
                            outer
                            solution by lipid bilayers. DNAorigami was used as a technology that uses staples as inputs
                            and
                            scaffolds as machine models that respond to inputs to resemble molecular robots. DNA origami
                            is
                            a nanoscale folding technology that enables the construction of two- or three- dimensional
                            nanostructures with arbitrary shapes. Two types of DNA strands, scaffolds and staples are
                            used
                            for construction of DNA origami nanostructures.
                            Scaffolds are long single stranded DNA with thousands of bases, while staples are short DNA
                            strands that bind to corresponding areas of scaffolds.
                            Our goal is to build liposome-type molecular robots that receive a large amount of data and
                            provide rapid feedback. It is expected that the DNA origami folding process is much more
                            efficient in small compartments such as liposomes than in bulk solution.

                            <h1>Design</h1>
                            To prove that DNA origami nanostructure can be folded in liposomes, the DNA origami
                            nanostructure must be larger than the hole diameter on the liposome. In addition, we
                            selected a
                            three dimensional shape for DNA origami design to prove that more complex structure can be
                            folded in the liposome. It means artificial cells can gain functionality by absorbing
                            scaffold
                            and staple from outside and folding even complex DNA origami structures(Fig.1.a). In future
                            experience, the DNA origami structure must be observed in liposomes to prove by using
                            fluorescence molecules that it was absorbed and folded in them. Because of this, the staple
                            chains at any position in the surface of the structure must be replaceable with fluorescent
                            alleys while maintaining stability(Fig.1.b to d).
